# SAS Tutor: Learn SAS Faster

## Overview

SAS Tutor is an interactive web application designed to help you learn and practice SAS programming more efficiently. It combines a chat interface powered by OpenAI's GPT model with a Pomodoro timer to enhance your learning experience.

## Features

1. **AI-powered SAS Tutor**: Ask questions about SAS programming and receive detailed explanations and code examples.
2. **Pomodoro Timer**: Built-in timer to help you manage your study sessions effectively.
3. **Code Highlighting**: Proper formatting and syntax highlighting for SAS code snippets.
4. **Conversation History**: Keep track of your learning progress within each session.

## How It Can Be Useful

- **Quick answers**: Get immediate responses to your SAS-related questions.
- **Code examples**: Receive relevant SAS code snippets to illustrate concepts.
- **Learning at your own pace**: Use the Pomodoro timer to structure your study sessions.
- **Hands-on practice**: Try out code examples directly in your SAS environment.

## Important Note: API Key Required

As a student project, this application requires users to provide their own OpenAI API key. Here's why:

1. **Cost**: OpenAI charges for API usage, and as a student, I cannot cover these costs for all users.
2. **Security**: Using your own API key ensures that your conversations remain private and under your control.

## Using the Application

1. Open [SAS_Tutor](https://fabianaltendorfer.github.io/sas_tutor/).
2. When prompted, enter your OpenAI API key.
3. Start asking questions about SAS in the input field.
4. Use the Pomodoro timer to manage your study sessions.

## How to Get an API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com) and sign up for an account.
2. Navigate to the API section and create a new API key.
3. Copy this key and keep it secure â€“ you'll need to enter it when you first use the SAS Tutor.

## Privacy and Data Usage

- Your API key and conversations are stored locally in your browser.
- No data is sent to any server other than OpenAI's API for processing your questions.

## Disclaimer

This is a student project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by SAS Institute Inc. or OpenAI. Use the application responsibly and be aware of any costs associated with your OpenAI API usage.


## Inspiration
The original idea for this project is not mine; I recreated a Python project inspired by:
